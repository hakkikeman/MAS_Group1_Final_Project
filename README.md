**A sophisticated multi-agent simulation of a bee colony ecosystem using JaCaMo framework and JavaFX visualization.**

---

## 📋 Overview

**Melissa** is an advanced multi-agent system that simulates the complex social behaviors and organizational structure of a bee hive. Built using the **JaCaMo** framework, this project demonstrates how autonomous agents can work together through beliefs, goals, and actions to maintain a thriving colony.

The simulation models realistic bee behaviors including:
- 🍯 **Honey production and resource management**
- 🌡️ **Temperature control within the hive**
- 🥚 **Colony reproduction and larva development**
- 🔍 **Exploration and food source discovery**
- 🛡️ **Hive defense mechanisms**

## ✨ Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Autonomous Agents** | Each bee operates independently with its own beliefs, goals, and decision-making |
| **Role-Based Organization** | Agents adopt roles (Queen, Nurse, Sentinel, Explorer) based on age and colony needs |
| **Real-Time Visualization** | JavaFX-powered graphics display hive state, bee movements, and statistics |
| **BDI Architecture** | Belief-Desire-Intention model for realistic agent behavior |
| **Dynamic Environment** | Simulated world with flowers, weather conditions, and seasonal changes |

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Java JDK 11+** with JavaFX support
- **Gradle** (included via wrapper)
- **Eclipse IDE** with JaCaMo plugin (recommended)

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/hakkikeman/MAS_Group1_Final_Project.git
cd MAS_Group1_Final_Project

# Run with Gradle
./gradlew run
```

### Eclipse Setup

1. Download [JDK 11+](https://adoptium.net/) with JavaFX
2. Install [Eclipse IDE](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)
3. Install JaCaMo plugin: [Installation Guide](http://jacamo.sourceforge.net/eclipseplugin/tutorial/)
4. Import project → Right-click `melissa.jcm` → **Run JaCaMo Application**

---

## 🎮 Usage

Once running, the simulation will display:

1. **Agent Activity Log** - Real-time actions and decisions of each bee
2. **Hive Visualization** - Graphical representation of the colony
3. **Statistics Panel** - Population, resources, and environmental data
